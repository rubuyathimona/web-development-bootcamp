<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a self-taught front-end software developer, currently engaged in formal studies in the same field. I have a deep passion for programming and am actively seeking an entry-level position within a reputable organization. Proficient in front-end development, I excel at problem-solving, pay close attention to detail, and have a quick learning curve. I'm equally comfortable working independently or collaboratively. I'm enthusiastic about contributing to meaningful projects and bringing positive energy to a professional software development environment.</p>
